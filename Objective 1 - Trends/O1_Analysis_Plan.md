Last Updated: November 01 2018

##### Cohort(s)

1.  Incident AF Cases between January 2011 to 2016
2.  Prevalent Cases between XXXX and 2016

##### Outcomes / Endpoint(s):

First prescription after diagnosis of AF within XX days of diagnosis.

##### Planned Analyses

1.  Describe incident and prevalent AF Cohorts stratified by age groups, sex, and SES over time.
    -   χ2 Test, t-test, ANOVA for differences in baseline characteristics where appropriate
    -   Test for Trend (Cochran–Armitage)

2.  Compute age and sex standardized rates of AF incidence and prevalence.
3.  Prescription initiation pattern over time (Warfarin vs. NOAC, and NOAC Specific) in incident cohort.
    -   Test for trend (Cochran–Armitage)

4.  Compare trends by Age, Sex, and SES in incident cohort
    -   Graphical comparisons.

##### Planned Figures

1.  Flowchart showing breakdown by Age, Sex, SES after exclusions
2.  Number of incident AF cases by year, prevalence over time.
3.  Percentage initiated on each drug. Overall, Age, Sex, SES. (Shows trends in incident cases)
4.  Percentage of total prescriptions each year (shows trends in prevalent cohort)

##### Planned Tables

1.  Baseline characteristics of incident and prevalent cases by age groups
2.  Baseline characteristics of incident and prevalent cases by sex groups
3.  Baseline characteristics of incident and prevalent cases by SES groups
4.  Baseline characteristics (Age, Sex, CHADs, Comorbidities) by OAC treatment choice. Warfarin vs NOAC, or specific NOAC.
