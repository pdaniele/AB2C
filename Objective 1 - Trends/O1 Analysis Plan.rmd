##### Cohort(s)
1. Incident AF Cases between January 2011 to 2016

##### Outcomes / Endpoint(s)
First prescription after diagnosis of AF within XX days of diagnosis.

##### Planned Analyses
1.  Compute incidence and prevalence of AF.
    * Crude rates
    * Direct standardized age and sex standardized rates
2.  Calculate proportion of AF patients who received OAC before and after NOAC introduction. (No OAC vs Warfarin)
    * Describe trend in proportion of patients receiving OAC each year.
    * Test for Trend (Cochran–Armitage)
4. 	Describe incident AF Cohort stratified by age groups, sex, and SES over time. 
    *	χ2 Test, t-test, ANOVA for differences in baseline characteristics where appropriate
    *	Test for Trend (Cochran–Armitage)
5.	Prescription initiation pattern over time (NO OAC vs. Warfarin vs. NOAC, and NOAC Specific) in incident cohort.
    *	Test for trend (Cochran–Armitage)
6.	Compare trends by Age, Sex, and SES in incident cohort 
    *	Graphical comparisons.


##### Planned Figures
1. Flowchart showing breakdown by Age, Sex, SES after exclusions
2. Number of incident AF cases by year, prevalence over time.
3. Percentage receiving OAC over time.
4. Percentage initiated on each drug over time (NO OAC, Warfarin, NOAC-by type). Overall, Age, Sex, SES. (Trends in incident cases)

##### Planned Tables
1.	Baseline characteristics by age groups
2.	Baseline characteristics by sex groups 
3.	Baseline characteristics by SES groups 
4.	Baseline characteristics by initial treatment. 
    * Warfarin vs NOAC and/or Warfarin vs specific NOACs.

##### Optional Analyses
1. Describe dosages of initiated medication (i.e. low vs high in dabigatran)
