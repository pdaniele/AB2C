Objective 2 - Analysis Plan
================
Last Updated: November 05 2018

##### Cohort(s)

1.  Incident Cohort
2.  Prevalent Cohort

##### Outcomes / Endpoint(s):

1.  Prescription vs No Prescription (OAC vs. No Prescription)
2.  First prescription (NOAC vs. Warfarin)
3.  Time to first switch.
4.  Number of switches.
5.  Proportion of patients with NOAC and Warfarin who switch drugs during follow-up.

##### Planned Analyses

1.  Explored factors associated with initial drug prescription using a logistic regression model.
    -   Multinomial logistic model with No OAC, Warfarin, NOAC as outcomes.

2.  Model time to first switch using cox proportion hazards model.
3.  Compare number of switches between groups.

##### Planned Figures

1.  Forest plot of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for initial drug prescription.
2.  Forest plot of unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for time to first switch.
3.  Kaplan Meier curves for time to first switch

##### Planned Tables

1.  OR/HR with 95% confidence intervals
2.  Proportion of patients who switch from either Warfarin or NOAC.

##### Optional Analyses
