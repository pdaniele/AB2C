### Overview:

This page describes the cohort definition and process for the project.

### Cohort

#### Prevalent AF Cases
Steps to identify prevalent AF Cases:

1. Identify AF diagnosis dates in each source
  - DAD - ICD10 = I48 in any diagnosis position
  - MSP - ICD9  = 4273 in any diagnosis position
  - NACRS - ICD10 = I48 in any diagnosis position
  - PNet - AF Specific medications
2. Identify pairs of AF diagnoses in MSP between 30 days and 2 years apart.
3. Merge diagnosis dates from each criteria, sort by date
4. Exclude cases based on BC Residency (Not registered at time of diagnosis)

#### Incident AF Cases
Steps to identify incident AF Cases:

1. Limit prevalent cases based on BC residency with a minimum 3 years lookback.

### Groups
1. Age - <65, 65-74, >=75 at diagnosis
2. Sex - Male, Female
